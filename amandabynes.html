	 <ul>
		 <li> Okay so I'm prefacing this by saying that this is a conspiracy theory. I'm not saying I believe all of this. </li> 
		 <li> I'm not trying to slander anybody, or upset any fans of any of the people mentioned in this. </li>
		 <li> This is very crazy. I also want to put a trigger warning because I'm mentioning sexual assult, pedophilia, incest, and drug use a lot throughout this. </li>
		 <li> Here is a video I made comparing amanda in a 2007 interview vs her in court in 2013 </li>
		   </ul>

	   <h5> Part 1 <h5>
		 
		   <br>
		   <p> Okay, so if you don't know amanda bynes she's a childhood actress. She was in 'All That', and eventually ended up with her own show, 'The Amanda Show'</p>
	 <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DAdf4xMXkAEdHy0.jpg" height="200" width="300">
		   <br>
		   <p> She also ended up doing movies like 'She's the man', 'What a girl wants', and 'Easy A'. </p>

		   <br>
		   <p> Everything was fine until 2013, she got in trouble for two hit and runs and it was reported that she was a coke addict.</p>
		   <br>
		   <p style="font-size:15px;"> Then, she started tweeting all these crazy tweets and nobody understood why she decided to say these things now ( Read Left To Right )</p>
		 <div class="amanda">

			   <p>After these tweets, she took the first video with 
				  the caption "Going Out" and the second video is a video of her at a gym that same night. </p>

			<p> Shortly after this she was forcefully taken to a hospital where she was on psychiartic hold, which is where the doctors can hold you there if they think you're unstable enough to hurt someone. Before this, her roommate recorded her talking about murdering her dad and sold it to TMZ (snitch smh) so here is that video.</p>

			<p>  So after that, she chekced into rehab, and since then she's still been weird but it's much calmer and it's not so intense. Okay, so here is  the theories of why homegirl lost her marbles. Her dad... She made accusations about him sexually abusing her. His dream was always to become a comedian. When he failed, he decided to use Amanda to his advantage. He signed her up for a comedy show when she was 10 years old. TEN. She said before she would have much rather done plays and musicals, not comedy shows and tv shows. SO he lived through her, and liked the money that came along with her being on tv.</p>   
		   <br>
		   <p> Okay, so now we discuss Nickelodeon. Specifically Dan Schneider. Please please remember this is a theory. I'm a huge nickelodeon fan, and I've loved all the shows Dan has produced/created. So this "evidence" is upsetting to me too :/. Okay so Dan Schneider is the creator "All That", "ICarly", "Zoey 101", "The Amanda Show", "Victorious", "Drake and Josh" etc... This is him </p>

			   <p> Apparently he's know for having a foot fetish. I mean the Nickelodeon logo is literally a giant foot. One time an account on a website (I don't remember lol I suck) claimed he was Robert Downey Jr wrote this about Dan</p>

			   <h5> Part 3 </h5>
			   <br>
			   <p> A child star by the name of Corey Feldman addressed Pedophilia in hollywood in the interview I show down below.</p>

				   <p> So now yall wanna know how all this ties to the illuminati? Project MK Ultra. "Declassified MKUltra documents
Project MKUltra, also called the CIA mind control program, is the code name given to a program of experiments on human subjects that were designed and undertaken by the United States Central Intelligence Agency—and which were, at times, illegal. Experiments on humans were intended to identify and develop drugs and procedures to be used in interrogations in order to weaken the individual and force confessions through mind control." - History.com. Conspiracy theorists think that MK Ultra wasn't shut down. They think they found a method that works, and even evolved it into microchips. Microchips placed in brains of popular celebrities. Microchips that work for 10 years, and every 10 years they put a new one in. Recepits that the Illuminati makes you sell your life away to them and leave everything behind from your old life. </p>

			   <p> They want to control your mind, your thoughts, your actions, even the way you prevent yourself, your sex appeal. EVERYTHING. So it's said that when a microchip starts reaching towards 10 years since the implant, it starts acting up. So  that's why celebrities go crazy. Brittany, Lindsay, Paris, AMANDA! So Amanda got her chip put in when she was 10 years old, thats when she started being in the spotlight. So when she was 20 she got a new one put in. Then she got a new one put in last year (2016) went crazy and went to rehab. Guess how old she was? 27. three years from 30. 3 years from a new microchip. Like i'm not saying amands is being mind controlled by the illuminati, but amanda is being controlled by the illumaniti.</p>

			   <p>(Okay,so like anyways any evidence about her father, dan schneider, or the dm me) (someone DM's her this) </p>

			 <p> Oh, by the way Katy Perry got famous in 2008 so she’s due for a chip change next year. Shake it up started in 2010. Bella Thorne’s getting crazier by the minute, 3 years until her chip replacement. Brittany Spears, Baby one more time was released in 1998. She had a breakdown in 2007 1 year for a new chip. For people saying some celebs don’t go crazy, some celebs can control it. They have small difficulties but some can keep it under control.It’s usually the celebrities with mental illness who have a bad reaction to the chip and freak out due to the chip malfunction when their close to the 10 year mark. </p>
