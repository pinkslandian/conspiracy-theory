    <h3> What is a Mandela Effect? </h3>
    <p> The Mandela Effect is a collective misremembering of a fact or event. Various theories have been proposed to explain what causes it, some more sensible than others. The Mandela Effect actually comes from Nelson Mandela. 
    Nelson Mandelaâ€™s death in 2013 was the initial event to spark the conspiracy because multiple people remembered him dying while in prison in the 1980s.
People claimed they recalled news clips and TV coverage of Nelson's funeral. But that's not what happened.
After being released from prison, the activist was the president of South Africa and he lived for the next three decades.
Below I may or may not blow your mind with some of my favorite mandela effects. </p>
