  <h2> What are conspiracy theories?</h2>  
    
    <p> Accodring to <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/theory"> Merriam-Webster </a> A conspiracy theory is: "An ideal or hypothetical set of facts, principles, or circumstances,  often used in the phrase in theory."

    <h2> Are conspiracy theorist crazy? No. </h2>
    <p> I won't lie, there has been some <i> crazy </i> accusations and some people go to <i> extreme </i> lenghts due to conspiracy theories. For the most part, these theories are for entertainment, or for figuring out real life things. 
    What are we kidding? Theory of evolution. Theory of gravity. Theory of light. Scientific theory.
    Basically,  a lot of theories ended up to be true, some false. It's all about your belief.  </p>
