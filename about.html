 <h1 style="text-align:center;"> <p>&hearts; About Me &hearts; <p> </h1>

<p id="indent"> I'm one of the most indecisive people you'll ever meet. 
I started a webpage about a conspiracy theory, and then changed it mid working beause 
I didn't think many people would take interest or understand it. Then I started to work
on my educational development plan but stopped because I don't even know exactly what I
want to do with my life. Then I started this 'personal blog', and went to just combine the two together.
I'm hoping this webpage ends in something
looking like tumblr. Some may say I'm indecisive because of my zodiac sign and being a libra the
scale may never be even. Who knows I may even change this idea. I am a detroit native, but I'll always
have a home in hamtramck, since that is where most of my memories lie. I currently go to Ferris State University
(go bulldogs) where I'm studying CIS. I originally wanted to study psychology, but my family shot that idea down
being that it doesn't bring money to the table and requires too much schooling. Inspired by my cousin, who is a 
computer engineer they pushed me to study CIS. That's what made me take up this internship at journi, and turns out I
really love it. Coding isn't bad, I actually enjoy it. Funny how things turn out. I thought psychology was my passion,
along with writing, and now coding. I think my passion is just to find my creative outlet. To find some type of release
to let the bad energy out, and not only help myself, but humanity as a whole. Who knows, maybe one day I'll be a cool hacker
stealing money from big bank men and giving it out to the poor. I'm pretty sure I'll write a poem about it one day. </p>
  
  
    
    <h3 style="text-align:center;"> <p>&hearts; Finding your invisible self &hearts; <p> </h3>
<p id="indent">I know you're probably thinking what do you mean find your invisible self? 
I'm right here reading this, Duh! We'll when I mean invisble self, I mean your conscience. Listening to yourself,
and figuring out who you really are. No matter what religion you follow, I think being spirtually aware, and being 
good with the universe (and yourself) will help you find your invisible self. For me, I am most in touch with myself 
when I get to write, or when I'm somewhere super quiet with nice scenery like the woods. (I absolutely LOVE camping.) 
I believe to find yourself you have get out of your comfort  zone and try things you never thought you'd ever do.
It's hard for a lot of people to find themselves because they're living for other people. It took me a really long time to realize that life is way too short to live for other people. 
There has been a lot of times where I did things that made me unhappy for the happiness of others. I've stopped
wearing clothes I liked, clothes that made me feel good because of what others thought. I am still learning to live 
for myself. I am learning to prioritize my happiness so that I could find out who I am. 
I know for a fact that we are all capable of achieving what we want no matter how big or small. 
One day we will all reach a point in our lives where we figure out where we belong. And at peace, we'll smile.  </p>
