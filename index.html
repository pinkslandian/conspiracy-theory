  <h2><u> What are conspiracy theories?</u></h2>

    <p> Accodring to <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/theory"> Merriam-Webster </a> A conspiracy theory is: "An ideal or hypothetical set of facts, principles, or circumstances,  often used in the phrase in theory."
    Conspiracy theories, and more generally misconceptions about public policy, are nothing new, but they are taking up greater prominence in media and political discourse seemingly like never before, and not just in the United States

    <h2><u> Are conspiracy theorist crazy? No.</u> </h2>
    <p> I won't lie, there has been some <i> crazy </i> accusations and some people go to <i> extreme </i> lenghts due to conspiracy theories. For the most part, these theories are for entertainment, or for figuring out real life things. 
    For example: Theory of evolution, Theory of gravity, Theory of light, and Scientific theory.
    Basically,  a lot of theories ended up to be true, some false. It's all about your belief.  </p>
